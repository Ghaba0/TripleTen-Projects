# Alcohol Age Verification

In this project, I'm tasked with helping Good Seed, a supermarket chain, ensure they adhere to alcohol sales laws by preventing underage sales. Leveraging the cameras installed in checkout areas, I'll develop and evaluate a computer vision model capable of estimating a person's age from photographs taken during alcohol purchases. The goal is to create a reliable system that accurately verifies age, ensuring that alcohol is only sold to customers of legal age.

To start, I loaded the data and performed some basic EDA with methods such as describe() and info(), aswell as making a graph to show the distribution of ages in the dataset. I then displayed a random sample of the images in the dataset to get an idea of what they look like.
